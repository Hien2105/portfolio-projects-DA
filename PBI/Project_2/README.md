# Project 2: Global Superstore Sales

## 1. Context
The dataset contains global sales information of a company named Superstore.  
It includes 3 data tables:  
- **Orders**: Stores transaction details.  
- **People**: Stores information about salespeople in each region.  
- **Returns**: Records transactions that were returned.  

## 2. Problem Statement
The senior manager wants to understand the company's business performance to develop strategies for market expansion and strategic product selection.  
Your task is to create a dashboard that helps stakeholders address these needs.  

## 3. Approach
I used the Design Thinking template for empathy and analysis, then selected the key metrics and dimensions for visualization. 

- Northstart metric 1: Revenue - Sales
- Northstart metric 2: Profit
- Dimension 1 - Time: Year, Quarter, Month
- Dimension 2 - Location: Markets, Regions, Countries, Cities
- Dimension 3 - Product: Prodcut Category
- Dimension 4 - Customer Segment: Customer Type
